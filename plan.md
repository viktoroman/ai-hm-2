# Angular User Management Application Development Plan

## Overview
This project involves developing a responsive Angular application that displays and manages user data from an external API. The application provides a professional, table-based interface with specific columns (name/email, address, phone, website, company name) for viewing user information, modal-based detailed user profiles with map integration, and essential data management operations. The application leverages modern Angular best practices including standalone components, OnPush change detection strategy, modern CSS best practices, smooth animations, and Jest for testing.
